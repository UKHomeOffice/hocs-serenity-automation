    Background:
      Given I log in as the designated user
      And I get a "DCU N10" case at "QA RESPONSE" stage
 
    @HOCS-310
    Scenario: User reviews draft, rejects it and provides a rejection reason
      When I "reject" the case
      Then the case should be moved to the "draft" stage
      And the case allocated to the "original drafter"
      And the "original drafter" and "nominated person" receive the "qa rejected email"
      And I am taken to the "home" page
      
    @HOCS-310 @FixMe
    Scenario: User reviews draft, rejects it and does not provide a rejection reason

      Then an error message appears instructing me to add rejection reasons
      
    @HOCS-309
    Scenario: User reviews draft and accepts the case
