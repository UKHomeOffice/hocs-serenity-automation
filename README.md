# hocs-serentiy-automation

This automated test pack uses the [Serenity BDD](http://www.thucydides.info/docs/serenity/) framework with Cucumber. If you are contributing to this framework, please try to use code from the Serenity library before using other code libraries or custom solutions. Above all, keep your code as simple as possible. If you have to write comments to explain what your code is doing, then it needs to be made more readable.

For more information, please consult the project [Wiki](https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/hocs-serenity-automation/wiki).

## Requirements

* [JDK 10](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) or above

## Contribution Guidelines

Contributions to this pack are always welcome. Please feel free to scrutinise the code within this pack and contribute, or feed improvements back to us.

Any code that is to be added to the `develop` branch must undergo code review. Prior to submitting your code for review, please ensure that you have tested your changes and you've run Inspect Code and Code Cleanup (`Ctrl + Alt + L`) on the files you've changed.

If you identify improvement opportunities that are unreleased to your specific changes, please raise a [new issue on GitHub](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/ndelius-serenity-automation/issues/new) so it can be picked up from the backlog. Remember, if it takes longer to raise a ticket than it does to make the improvement, make the improvement.
